# Swarm of Micro Flying Robots in the Wild

## Overview
This project develops **palm‑sized autonomous drones** capable of navigating cluttered wild environments (e.g., forests) using onboard sensors and a spatial‑temporal trajectory planner. The system enables safe swarm coordination, obstacle avoidance, and flexible mission execution **without relying on external infrastructure**.

**Type:** Academic Project (Research Simulation)

---

## Features
- Swarm coordination of multiple micro‑drones
- Autonomous obstacle avoidance in unknown terrain
- Spatial‑temporal trajectory planning
- Realistic simulation in complex environments
